Three steps are required to run frida-server on the device. First, the frida-server binary needs to be pushed to a writable location using adb. 
Next, execution permissions need to be set with chmod, and finally, the frida-server needs to be run as root. 

adb push frida-server /data/local/tmp/
Open a shell and change to the root user:

    E:\lab-files\frida> adb shell
    x86_64:/ $ su
    x86_64:/ #

Go to the /data/local/tmp folder and change the executable flag:

    x86_64:/ # cd /data/local/tmp
    x86_64:/data/local/tmp # chmod +x frida-server

Finally, run the frida-server binary:

    x86_64:/data/local/tmp # ./frida-server

Use ADB To Install Android Apps Apk File.

1.1 Push app apk file to android device.
//Push to system app folder
adb push example.apk /system/app.
//Push to user app folder
adb push example.apk /data/app.
This method has below disadvantages.

Maybe overwrite the original app, so you had better use below command to backup the original app before operation.
// Pull android apk from device to local folder.
adb pull /system/app/example.apk    /user/app_bak
Usually, you can encounter below error messages.
failed to copy '/user/example.apk' to '/system/app/example.apk': Read-only file system.
This is bacause /system/app folder is read-only, you can not push files into this folder.

To resolve this problem, you need to use adb install command with -r option to force install the apk files, we will introduce it below.

// -r means force install.
adb install -r /user/example.apk
Above adb install apk file command will install the apk file into /data/local/tmp/ directory.

From local
Run adb install apk file command as below to push android app into emulator /data/app directory.
adb install C:/work/example.apk

After you have created your payload, like an APK, you have to sign it.

On Windows (as administrator)
  cmd
On Mac
  terminal
On Linux
  terminal


In Windows the path you will need is similar to:
  c:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_271\bin

keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
Press Enter on all [Unknown] detail items and at [no], type yes and press enter

Copy the my-release-key.keystore to the directory where the APK file is.  Then run the following.
  jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore ngroktest.apk alias_name

You can also use APK signer.  https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apksigner  The apksigner tool, available in revision 24.0.3 and higher of the Android SDK Build Tools, allows you to sign APKs and 
to confirm that an APK's signature will be verified successfully on all versions of the Android platform supported by those APKs.
